			<h2>PPC - Archieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click (PPC) Marketing</h2>
			<p>PPC (pay-per click) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PPC Automation - While it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of pay-per click advertising, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your business.</li>
				<li>PPC Management - PPC management refers to the maintenance and prioritization of paid search marketing tasks. Being able to oversee various aspects of your account while assingning each item on a seemingly endless to-do list an appropriate value can make or break an online ad campaign</li>

			<p>WordStream's PPC software is specifically designed to aid in these two PPC search engine marketing areas. This page will show you both the processes the software is automating for you, and the best course of action to take where workflow is concerned.</p>
